# 🔵 Based Agent

An experimental playground for autonomous onchain interactions, and the starting point of the autonomous onchain agent revolution. 

## Introduction

Based Agent helps LLM agents directly interact with the blockchain, built on top of the [Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP)](https://cdp.coinbase.com/) and OpenAI's [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm). This is meant to be a template where anyone can add their own features and functions that can be autonomously executed by an agent with access to the entire onchain ecosystem.

### Key Features

- **Autonomous execution**: The agent thinks, decides, and acts onchain autonomously.
- **Token deployement**: Create and manage ERC-20 tokens.
- **NFT Deployment**: Deploy and mint NFTs. 
- **Asset transfers**: Transfer assets between addresses without manual intervention.
- **Balance checks**: Keep tabs on wallet balances.
- **ETH faucet requests**: Automatically request testnet ETH when needed.
- **Art generation via DALL-E**: Generate artwork using AI.
- **Whatever you want**: Add in features and share them with us!

### Why BasedAgent?

Imagine an AI agent that not only interacts with the blockchain but does so creatively and autonomously. Whether you're a developer, an artist, or someone curious about AI, Based Agent offers a unique and exciting playground to:

- Experiment with autonomous agent capabilities.
- Explore on-chain actions without manual coding.
- Understand the potential of AI onchain.

## Get Started in Minutes!

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Replit Core Account (optional, but recommended for easy setup).  Contact kevin.leffew@coinbase.com for a Sponsorship

### 2️⃣ API Configuration
Add your secrets to Replit's Secret Manager or set them as environment variables:
- `CDP_API_KEY_NAME`: Your CDP API key name.
- `CDP_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your CDP private key.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.

You can get the Coinbase Developer Platform API key here: [https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects/api-keys)
And the OpenAI key here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys (note you will need to have a paid account)

### 3️⃣ Running the Agent

After adding your API Keys to the Secrets pane, you start the agent by pressing the green "▶ Run" Button at the top of the editor

Alternatively, you can start the based agent manually by navigating to the Replit shell and running:

```bash
python run.py
```

### Watch the Magic Happen! ✨

The Based Agent will start its autonomous loop:

- Wakes up every 10 seconds.
- Chooses an onchain action based on its capabilities.
- Executes the action onchain.
- Prints results in a human-readable format.

## 🤔 How Does BasedAgent Work?

Based Agent makes decisions and interacts with the blockchain autonomously. Here's what happens under the hood:

- **Decision making**: The agent decides what action to perform next.
- **Onchain interaction**: Executes blockchain transactions using the CDP SDK.
- **Art generation**: If needed, generates art using OpenAI's DALL-E.
- **Feedback loop**: Analyzes results and plans the next action.

## 🔧 Available Functions

Unlock a world of possibilities with these built-in functions:

### Token Operations

- `create_token(name, symbol, initial_supply)`: Create a new ERC-20 token.
- `transfer_asset(amount, asset_id, destination_address)`: Transfer assets to a specific address.
- `get_balance(asset_id)`: Check the wallet balance of a specific asset.

### NFT Operations

- `deploy_nft(name, symbol, base_uri)`: Deploy a new ERC-721 NFT contract.
- `mint_nft(contract_address, mint_to)`: Mint an NFT to a specified address.

### Utilities

- `request_eth_from_faucet()`: Request ETH from the Base Sepolia testnet faucet.
- `generate_art(prompt)`: Generate art using DALL-E based on a text prompt.

### Advanced (Experimental)

- `create_liquidity_pool(token0_address, token1_address, fee_tier, amount0, amount1)`: Create a Uniswap V3 liquidity pool and add initial liquidity.

## 🤖 Agent Functionality

### Agents.py
All of the functionality for the Based Agent resides within `agents.py`. This is the central hub where you can add new capabilities, allowing the agent to perform a wide range of tasks. 

Using the CDP SDK, the agent is equipped to interact with any arbitrary on-chain activity or function. 

By incorporating additional libraries, you can extend the agent's reach beyond blockchain interactions to include Web2 functionalities, such as posting on X, etc.

### Run.py
Within `run.py`, you have the flexibility to engage the agent in various ways:
1. **Chat-Based Communication**: This mode enables you to have a natural language conversation with the agent, allowing it to execute tasks on your behalf through Natural Language Processing (NLP).
2. **One-Agent Autonomous Mode**: In this mode, provide the agent with a static prompt, and it will execute tasks based on its internal decision-making processes and predefined capabilities.
3. **Two-Agent Autonomous Mode**: Here, the setup involves another instance of communication, where a second agent provides dynamic prompting to the primary agent. This setup allows more complex interactions and task executions, providing an exciting opportunity to explore how agents can work together and autonomously.

## 🤖 Behind the Scenes

Based Agent uses:

- **Coinbase Developer Platform SDK**: For seamless onchain interactions.
- **OpenAI Swarm**: Powers the agent's autonomous decision-making.
- **DALL-E**: Generates art from textual descriptions.

## Next Steps
- Feel free to fork this repl, and remix or extend it.  You may wish to add a front-end, more function calls, or any other functionality that may be desired.
